# ðŸŽµ Fortnite Festival Path Data

This repository contains **Festival Path Data** collected from *Festival Tracker* for public use.

Total Jam Tracks: **2354**

## ðŸ“¦ About

The data is collected through a custom-built **Discord bot** designed to extract song path data directly from the *Festival Tracker bot's* messages.

Special thanks to **Festival Central** â€” the largest Fortnite Festival community â€” for allowing the bot in their server!

If I'm missing any path data that you'd like to be added, my bot is more then likely to collect it in Festival Central so just use the /path command in there and it'll be added.
